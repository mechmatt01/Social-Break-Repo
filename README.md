# Social Break
 
Social Break helps make your day to day breaks healthier and more productive. It does this by reminding you to take breaks with a goal you set to be not only productive on that break but also gets you off of your phone and into a world of happiness and self-care. 

With Social Break you can set the amount of time that you would like to take a break for and then view the remaining time for your break. During your break, you can turn on custom calming sounds that correspond to the background image that you set to help you better enjoy your break and get into that relaxed yet productive state.

Social Break features...
- Reminders to take a daily break
- Stats such as the total time spent on breaks and more
- Goals to help make your break productive yet relaxing
- Background images for each break
- A clean and simple interface
